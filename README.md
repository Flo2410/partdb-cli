# PartDB CLI

> This is still work-in-progress!

This is a basic CLI to interact with [PartDB](https://github.com/Part-DB/Part-DB-server).

## Motivation

I have hundreds of parts lying around, which I want to add to my PartDB instance.
But entering all the parts manually (even with the duplicate function) takes forever.
Therefore, I'm creating this basic CLI to easily and semi-automated add parts to PartDB.
